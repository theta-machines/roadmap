# Theta Machines Public Roadmap
This repository allows us to track issues specific to our roadmap. To see the roadmap, [head over to its project page](https://github.com/orgs/theta-machines/projects/1).

## Accuracy Disclaimer
Our roadmap is a tool to help track progress throughout development cycles. None of the information is guaranteed to be accurate. 

The roadmap is a living document, meaning information is going to change frequently. Deadlines will be missed, projects will get put on the back-burner, and some projects might be abandoned altogether. The important thing is that you can tag along while we do our best to build an open industry.
