# Theta Machines Public Roadmap
This repository is meant to make our work more transparent by showing where our time is being alloted. It also lets us track issues that might not pertain to a specific project. 

To see this roadmap, head over to the `Projects` tab!

## Accuracy Disclaimer
This repository is a tool to help track our progress throughout development cycles. None of the information (especially dates) are guaranteed to be accurate. 

This is a living roadmap, meaning information is going to change frequently. Deadlines will be missed; projects will get put on the back-burner; some projects might be abandoned altogether. The important thing is that you can tag along while we do our best to build an open industry.
